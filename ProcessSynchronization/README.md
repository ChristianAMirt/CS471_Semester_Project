-To compile this project on Windows, use the command `./gradlew build` in the root directory.

-To run the program, add a sample input file to `src/main/data` or use existing file and run the command `./gradlew run --args="src/main/data/sample-input.txt"`, replacing `sample-input.txt` with the desired file name. The resulting output files will be in `results/` with each named by their respective input file and which core it is.
